Use the shortcode [archive] to list all posts from Archive with status publish to a page or post.
The shortcode can use different params and use the follow defaults.

	'count'         => -1, // count or -1 for all posts
	'category'      => '', // Show posts associated with certain categories.
	'tag'           => '', // Show posts associated with certain tags.
	'post_status'   => 'publish', // status or all for all posts
	'echo'          => 'true', // echo or give an array for use external
	'return_markup' => 'ul', // markup before echo title, content
	'title_markup'  => 'li', // markup before item
	'content'       => 'false', // view also content?
	'debug'         => 'false' // debug mor vor view an array

An example for use shortcode with params: `[archive count="10" content="true"]`

Also you can change the parameters to create the custom post type of the Archiv via the filter hook `archive_post_type_arguments`.
